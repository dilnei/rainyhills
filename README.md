Rainy Hills: Uses Multiple Java EE 7 Technologies Deployed as an EAR
==============================================================================================
Author: Dilnei Cunha

Level: Advanced

Technologies: EAR, EJB, JPA

Summary: Application which takes an array as an input, and calculates the volume of water which remained after the rain, in units.

Target Project: CRX

Source: <https://github.com/CRX/rainyhills/>

What is it?
-----------

This is a CRX test task, a Java EE Coding Exercise.


System requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 8 (Java SDK 1.8) or better, Maven 3.1 or better.

The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss WildFly.

 
Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md) before testing the quickstarts.


Start JBoss WildFly with the Web Profile
-------------------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat

 
Start JBoss WildFly with the full Java EE Profile
-------------------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone-full.xml
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone-full.bat


Build and Deploy the Rainy Hills
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the RainyHills](https://github.com/CRX/rainyhills) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean package wildfly:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/rainyhills.ear` to the running instance of the server.


Access the application 
---------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/rainyhills-web>.

1. Enter a name, email address, and Phone nubmer in the input field and click the _Register_ button.
2. If the data entered is valid, the new member will be registered and added to the _Members_ display list.
3. If the data is not valid, you must fix the validation errors and try again.
4. When the registration is successful, you will see a log message in the server console:

        Registering _the_name_you_entered_


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn wildfly:undeploy


Run the Arquillian Tests 
-------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container. 

_NOTE: The following commands assume you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Run the Arquillian Tests](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/RUN_ARQUILLIAN_TESTS.md) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test -Parq-wildfly-remote


Investigate the Console Output
---------------------
You should see the following console output when you run the tests:

    Results :
    Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0


Investigate the Server Console Output
---------------------
You should see messages similar to the following:

    INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 10) JBAS018558: Undeployed "test.war"


Run the RainyHills in Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the rainyhills from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see [Use Eclipse to Run the RainyHills](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_RH.md) 


Debug the Application
---------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
